# coffee-machine
This is a day 15 project from "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023." by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

A coffee machine that:
- has a menu of 3 coffees
- can be switched off
- can print report of available milk, water, coffee, and of profit
- can give change
- updates resources after each transaction
- rejects transaction if not enough money or not enough resources available

I also added a future that wasn't required - if a user enters anything outside of 5 options, the programme doesn't break.
